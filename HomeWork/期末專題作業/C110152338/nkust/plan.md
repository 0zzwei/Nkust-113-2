# Plan for Completing the Online Course Platform

## Implemented Features

Based on the existing codebase, the following features are already implemented:

*   Course management (CRUD operations)
*   Data models for courses, users, and enrollments
*   Database context for accessing the data

## Remaining Features

The following features are missing or incomplete:

*   User authentication and authorization
*   Enrollment functionality
*   Admin login

## Plan

To complete the remaining features, I will follow these steps:

1.  **Implement User Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   Add a `UsersController` with actions for registering, logging in, and managing users.
    *   Implement authentication using ASP.NET Core Identity or a similar framework.
    *   Implement authorization to restrict access to certain actions based on user roles (e.g., Admin).
2.  **Implement Enrollment Functionality:**
    *   Add an `EnrollmentsController` with actions for enrolling and unenrolling users in courses.
    *   Update the `CoursesController` to display enrollment information.
3.  **Implement Admin Login:**
    *   Create a login page for administrators.
    *   Implement authentication for administrators.
    *   Restrict access to the admin-side features based on administrator login.
4.  **Connect the Backend to the Frontend:**
    *   Define the API endpoints for the frontend to consume.
    *   Ensure that the API endpoints are properly documented.
5.  **Implement the Frontend (Angular):**
    *   Create the UI components for browsing courses, viewing course details, enrolling in courses, and managing user accounts.
    *   Connect the frontend to the backend API endpoints.
6.  **Implement the Admin-Side Features (Angular):**
    *   Create the UI components for managing courses and viewing user enrollments.
    *   Connect the frontend to the backend API endpoints.
